# Model-driven Machine Learning
### with Template-based code generation and mapping configuration

#### A Master thesis Proof-of-concept implementation

# General information
This repository contains code for the Proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation done for the Master of Science in Information 
and Software Engineering at the [University of Applied Sciences Dornbirn](https://www.fhv.at/en/).

This implementation was done at [V-Research](https://www.v-research.eu/).

# Description
The

The goals of the PoC implementation are as follows:
 - Make use of a custom SysML profile for Machine Learning (ML) to model ML processes to execute on a system or data of a system
 - Develop a metamodel and model transformations to extract information from the SysML model to the intermediate model conforming to said metamodel
 - Generate executable ML code from a SysML model using the intermediate model and Template-based code generation (TBCG)
 - Write the templates for the stereotypes from the custom SysML profile
 - Offer a mapping configuration mechanism that allows the user to map SysML elements to template variables

The findings will then be transferred to the Master thesis.
