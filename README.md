# Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach to generate Machine Learning Code based on SysML and Mapping Configuration
## General information
This repository contains code for the Proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation done for the Master of Science in Information 
and Software Engineering at the [University of Applied Sciences Dornbirn](https://www.fhv.at/en/).

This work was supervised and conceptually elaborated at the [Chair of Information Systems and Business Process Management (i17), Department of Computer Science, Technical University of Munich](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/bpm/chair/)

## Description
This Poc implementation is based on a recently published approach to machine learning modeling with SysML at INDIN 2022 (ref. follows as soon as proceedings are online).

The goals of the PoC implementation are as follows:
 - Use of an existing SysML profile for machine learning (ML) modeling, which can be used to describe data, interfaces, ML processing, and to define ML algorithms
 - Develop a model transformation to extract information from the SysML model into the intermediate model. The intermediate model must be defined as a metamodel beforehand
 - Generating executable ML code from a SysML model using the intermediate model and template-based code generation
 - Definition of ML templates for specific stereotypes from the user-defined SysML profile, which are used as the basis for generation
 - Provide a mapping configuration mechanism that allows the user to map SysML elements to template variables and exchange them dynamically
