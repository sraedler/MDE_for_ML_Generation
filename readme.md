# Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach to generate Machine Learning Code based on SysML and Mapping Configuration
## General information
This repository contains code for the Proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation for a SysML-based MDE4AI approach.
Particularly, this repository contains code that enables to generate machine learning code using model transformation.

The approach is based on a SySML formalization using Stereotypes.
Since the reviewing process shall remain anonymous, further information on the authors related publication are hidden.
